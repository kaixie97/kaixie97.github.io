Welcome! Iâ€™m a second-year PhD student in economics at the [Survey and Research Center for China Household Finance](https://chfs.swufe.edu.cn/) (CHFS) and [Research Institute of Economics and Management](https://riem.swufe.edu.cn/) (RIEM) of [Southwestern University of Finance and Economics](https://www.swufe.edu.cn/) (SWUFE) in Chengdu, China. Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor's degree in economics from the [School of Economics at Henan University](http://jjxy.henu.edu.cn/).

My research interests cover digital economics, development economics, labor economics, and public economics. The current research focuses on three aspects. First, the impact of the digital revolution on the household and business sectors, especially the inclusiveness of digital technology and its differences from previous technological advances. Secondly, the implications of human capital investment, mismatch and improvement on economic activities, and the role played by industrial policies and education policies. Finally, the efficiency and welfare of government public goods supply, especially the effectiveness evaluation of infrastructure constructions and large-scale transfer payments in China's rural development strategies such as poverty alleviation and rural revitalization.
