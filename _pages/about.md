Welcome! Iâ€™m a second-year PhD. student in economics at the [Research Institute of Economics and Management](https://riem.swufe.edu.cn/) (RIEM) of [Southwestern University of Finance and Economics](https://www.swufe.edu.cn/) (SWUFE) in Chengdu, China. Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor's degree in economics from the [School of Economics at Henan University](http://jjxy.henu.edu.cn/).

My research interests cover digital economics, development economics, labor economics, and public economics. The current research focuses on three main areas. Firstly, the impact of digital revolution on the efficiency and welfare for the household and enterprise sectors, especially the inclusiveness of digital technologies. Secondly, the implications of human capital mismatch and improvement on economic activities, and the role played by industrial policies and education policies. Finally, the effectiveness evaluation of infrastructure constructions and large-scale transfer payments in China's rural development strategies such as poverty alleviation and rural revitalization.
