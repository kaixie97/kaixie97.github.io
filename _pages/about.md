Welcome! Iâ€™m a third-year PhD student in economics at the [Survey and Research Center for China Household Finance](https://chfs.swufe.edu.cn/) (CHFS) and [Research Institute of Economics and Management](https://riem.swufe.edu.cn/) (RIEM) at [Southwestern University of Finance and Economics](https://www.swufe.edu.cn/) (SWUFE) in Chengdu, China. Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor's degree in economics from the [School of Economics at Henan University](http://jjxy.henu.edu.cn/).

My research interests encompass labor economics, household Economics, development economics, and public economics. My current research focuses on three aspects. First, it explores the consequences of human capital investment, skills mismatch, and enhancements in economic activities, while considering the influence of industrial and educational policies. Second, it examines the impact of the digital revolution on households and businesses, with a particular focus on the inclusivity of digital technology compared to previous technological advancements. Lastly, it evaluates the efficiency and welfare implications of government public goods provision, specifically assessing the effectiveness of infrastructure development and public services in influencing the economic behavior of micro households in terms of consumption, employment, and income.
