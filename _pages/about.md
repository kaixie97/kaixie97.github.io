This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Welcome! I’m a second-year PhD. student in Economics at the [Research Institute of Economics and Management](https://riem.swufe.edu.cn/) (RIEM) of [Southwestern University of Finance and Economics](https://www.swufe.edu.cn/) (SWUFE) in Chengdu, China. Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor's degree in economics from the [School of Economics at Henan University](http://jjxy.henu.edu.cn/) in Zhengzhou/Kaifeng, China.

My research fields are development economics, urban economics and international economics. The common thread of my research is in understanding industrial development across China, and its relation to China’s growing prominence in the global market, as well as China’s location on the global value chain. My current focus is to uncover the role of Chinese diasporas in facilitating China’s transition from a closed state toward the second largest open economy in the world. See here for details.

For more information, please refer to my CV or my motivation for a research career.
