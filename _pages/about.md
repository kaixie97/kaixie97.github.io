Welcome! I’m a second-year PhD. student in economics at the [Research Institute of Economics and Management](https://riem.swufe.edu.cn/) (RIEM) of [Southwestern University of Finance and Economics](https://www.swufe.edu.cn/) (SWUFE) in Chengdu, China. Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor's degree in economics from the [School of Economics at Henan University](http://jjxy.henu.edu.cn/).

My research fields are development economics, urban economics and international economics. The common thread of my research is in understanding industrial development across China, and its relation to China’s growing prominence in the global market, as well as China’s location on the global value chain. My current focus is to uncover the role of Chinese diasporas in facilitating China’s transition from a closed state toward the second largest open economy in the world. See here for details.

For more information, please refer to my CV or my motivation for a research career.
